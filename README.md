## Installation

### Pre-requisite Tasks

Here are some pre-requisite tasks that you'll have to take complete before starting installation:

1. In Telegram App/Desktop, search for "BotFather". Click on "Start", and enter the following command:
```
  /newbot
```
2. Follow the instructions on screen:

    * Choose a name for your bot. 
    * Select a username for your bot that ends with "bot" (this is a rule Telegram enforces).

3. BotFather will confirm the creation of your bot and provide a HTTP API access token.
4. Copy and save this token for future use.

### Actual Installation

The below instructions can be followed in order to set-up communication with the bot from your end in a span of few minutes! Let's get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Start a terminal session in the directory where the project has been cloned. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. In the directory where this repo has been cloned, please run the below command to execute a bash script to run the Telegram Bot:
```
   ./run.sh
```
(OR)
```
   bash run.sh
```
4. It will ask you to paste the API token you received from Telegram in pre-requisites step 4.
5. A successful run will generate a message on your terminal that says "TeleBot: Started polling." 
6. In the Telegram app, search for your newly created bot by entering the username and open the same.
  
   Now, on Telegram, enter the "/start" or "/menu" command, and you are all set to track your expenses with DollarBot!

## Testing

  We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:

  ```
  python run -m pytest test/
  ```
  (OR)
  ```
  python -m pytest test/
  ```

  Currently we have over **155** tests covering all functionalities of the bot. See the below output for more details.

  ![Tests output](docs/images/tests.png)

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```

## Usage

We have tried to make this application (bot) as easy as possible. You can use this bot to manage and track you daily expenses and not worry about loosing track of your expenses. As we also have given in a functionality of graphing and plotting and history of expenses, it becomes easy for the user to track expenses.

## Configuration

As a user, there's no need to configure any parameters
As a contributor, we have tried to make the system as decoupled as possible so that changes to one module/program doesn't affect other ones. With this being said, here are some configuration knobs that we have exposed for contributors:
1. Adding categories,
2. Removing categories,
3. Graphing changes,
4. Changing Telegram bot names etc.

## :interrobang: Troubleshooting


1) Ensure that you have a valid bot token. You can obtain a token by creating a new bot on Telegram through the BotFather.
2) Double-check that the token is correctly inserted into your bot's code or configuration.
3) Make sure your bot has the necessary permissions to perform the actions you've programmed it for.
4) If the issue still persists, please consider writing us at dollarbot38@googlegroups.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
5) You're also free to report a bug in our repository and clearly stating the issue that you're facing. Please make sure to follow the guidelines mentioned in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ymdatta/DollarBot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
